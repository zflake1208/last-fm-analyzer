# LastFMAnalyzer
LastFMAnalyzer is a personal project to demonstrate my skills with programming, specifically with Python.

This program utilizes the Last.FM API to gather community-sourced music information. These range from artists, tracks, albums, to global and local listening charts.

Originally, the API was specifically used with HTML POST requests. This program includes a last_fm_api package that I developed to translate Python calls into these POST requests. These API calls are then used through the CLI menu.

Most functions also include an auto-generated graph using matplotlib, which can then be saved to the user's machine for future reference.

v1.0 has been added to the releases for easy launching, and to avoid library issues.
